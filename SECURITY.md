# Security Policy for Raney-org

## Supported Versions

Since the 'Mkdocs-material' repository doesn't have any releases or published packages, this security policy applies to the latest version of the source code in the main branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the 'Mkdocs-material' project, please follow these steps:

1. Do not create a public GitHub issue to report the vulnerability, as this may expose sensitive information and put other users at risk.
2. Instead, send an email to the project maintainers at "support@ranevm.com" with the subject "Security Vulnerability in Mkdocs-material." In the email, provide a clear and detailed description of the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it and any relevant information (e.g., potential impact, affected components, etc.).
3. Allow the project maintainers some time to investigate and address the issue. They will get back to you with their findings and any further instructions or questions.

## Disclosure Policy

Please give the project maintainers a reasonable amount of time to fix the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly. Once the vulnerability has been resolved, or if a specific timeline for resolution has been agreed upon, you may disclose the vulnerability responsibly. Always prioritize the safety and security of the project's users when disclosing any information about the vulnerability.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have any suggestions or feedback on this security policy, please open an issue in the 'Raney-org/Mkdocs-material' repository.

Remember to replace "support@ranevm.com" with the appropriate email address for your project maintainers. This will allow them to handle security reports privately and efficiently.
