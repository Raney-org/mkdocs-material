## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Weasel words, or weaselers, are terms used to qualify a claim to make it easier to accept and more difficult to reject by introducing some degree of probability or “watering down” the claim without really changing its implied significance. Weasel words such as probably, most, seems, in a sense, up to, and many others can have this same effect—they make a claim sound better than it may actually be and make it more difficult to show that the claim is false.

The word "always" does not qualify (or weaken) a claim, so it is not a weasel word.

"It follows that" is a conclusion indicator, not a weasel word.
