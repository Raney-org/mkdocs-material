## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

An argumentative essay is a genre of writing that presents a logical and methodical defense of a thesis based on supporting research. It includes the recognition of the opposing position to the thesis and the presentation of a successful rebuttal.

Persuasive writing includes elements that are intended to motivate and persuade an audience in ways that may go beyond the boundaries of logic, such as passion or emotion.

Argumentative essays do not have the goal of making the topic interesting and engaging, but to provide a systematic defense of a thesis.

For a more in-depth discussion of this topic see section 9.1.
