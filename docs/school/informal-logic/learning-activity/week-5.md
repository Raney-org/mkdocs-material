## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

An argumentative essay is a genre of writing that presents a logical and methodical defense of a thesis based on supporting research. It includes the recognition of the opposing position to the thesis and the presentation of a successful rebuttal.

Persuasive writing includes elements that are intended to motivate and persuade an audience in ways that may go beyond the boundaries of logic, such as passion or emotion.

Argumentative essays do not have the goal of making the topic interesting and engaging, but to provide a systematic defense of a thesis.

## WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 2

When presenting objections, it is important to present the best possible objection to your argument. Otherwise, this makes it seem as though your conclusion is not based on a fair consideration of the best arguments on both sides.

It also prevents one from committing the straw man fallacy, which occurs when one presents a weak representation of the other side in order to make that side seem easier to dismiss.

Presenting a strong objection does not make it less likely that someone will accept the opposing argument, but it is necessary to address the strongest objection if you want to address the question fairly and honestly.

Presenting strong objections does not necessarily prevent people accepting conclusions based on emotion. However, it does allow them to get a more fair understanding of the arguments on both sides.
