# This should be my rough draft for school

The pervasive use of social media in today's society has sparked a lively debate on its impact on relationships. As a powerful communication tool, social media has the potential to both enhance and undermine the connections we have with others. In this paper, we will delve into the complex relationship between social media and interpersonal relationships, providing a balanced analysis of the best arguments from both proponents and critics. Our investigation will encompass the positive aspects of social media, such as fostering communication and maintaining long-distance connections, as well as the negative aspects, including the potential for addiction, cyberbullying, and the erosion of genuine face-to-face interactions. Drawing on scholarly evidence, we will present our own argument for the overall effect of social media on relationships and address the strongest counterarguments. By thoroughly examining the diverse perspectives on this issue, our aim is to arrive at a well-reasoned conclusion that sheds light on the true impact of social media on our interpersonal connections.

## First Argument (for)

First Argument: Social media improves relationships by enhancing communication and connection.

Premise 1: Social media platforms enable users to maintain contact with friends and family, regardless of geographical distance.
Premise 2: Social media facilitates the sharing of experiences and updates, fostering a sense of involvement in each other's lives.
Premise 3: Social media allows for the formation of new connections and relationships based on shared interests and values.
Premise 4: Social media provides a platform for support and encouragement in times of need, creating a sense of community and belonging.

Conclusion: Social media plays a positive role in improving relationships by enhancing communication and connection.

In this argument, we emphasize the benefits of social media in maintaining and fostering relationships. Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, allow users to stay in touch with friends and family members, no matter how far apart they may be geographically. By sharing experiences, updates, and milestones, users can remain involved in each other's lives, strengthening their bonds. Furthermore, social media enables individuals to form new connections based on shared interests, values, and hobbies. These connections can lead to meaningful relationships, both online and offline. Lastly, social media platforms can serve as a source of support and encouragement during difficult times, creating a sense of community and belonging among users. Thus, the improved communication and connection offered by social media positively impact relationships.

## Second Argument (against)

Second Argument: Social media harms relationships by encouraging superficial interactions and fostering negative behaviors.

Premise 1: Social media promotes superficial interactions and reduces the quality of face-to-face communication.
Premise 2: The constant need for validation through likes and comments on social media can lead to addiction and negatively affect mental health.
Premise 3: Social media can facilitate cyberbullying, leading to strained or broken relationships.
Premise 4: The curated nature of social media profiles can create unrealistic expectations and comparisons, resulting in dissatisfaction with one's relationships.

Conclusion: Social media can harm relationships by fostering superficial interactions, addictive behaviors, and negative experiences.

In this argument, we focus on the potential downsides of social media use and its impact on relationships. Social media platforms can encourage superficial interactions, as users often prioritize the quantity of connections over the quality of communication. This shift can reduce the depth and authenticity of face-to-face conversations. Additionally, the constant need for validation through likes, comments, and shares can lead to addictive behaviors and negatively affect mental health, straining relationships in the process. Social media also provides a platform for cyberbullying, which can significantly damage relationships and cause emotional distress. Finally, the curated and idealized nature of social media profiles can create unrealistic expectations and promote unhealthy comparisons, leading to dissatisfaction with one's relationships. Consequently, social media use can harm relationships by encouraging superficial interactions and fostering negative behaviors.

## Analysis

In evaluating the quality of the two arguments presented above, it is essential to consider the truth or support of the key premises and the logical strength of the conclusions derived from them.

The first argument posits that social media improves relationships by enhancing communication and connection. The premises supporting this argument are generally well-supported by research. For instance, studies have shown that social media platforms facilitate the maintenance of contact with friends and family across geographical distances (Bayer et al., 2016) and enable users to form new connections based on shared interests and values (Ellison et al., 2007). Additionally, social media has been found to provide a platform for support and encouragement during difficult times (Nabi et al., 2013). While the premises are backed by evidence, the conclusion that social media plays a positive role in improving relationships may not account for the potential negative aspects.

The second argument contends that social media harms relationships by encouraging superficial interactions and fostering negative behaviors. This argument also presents well-supported premises. Research has shown that social media can reduce the quality of face-to-face communication (Turkle, 2015) and lead to addictive behaviors that negatively affect mental health (Kuss & Griffiths, 2017). Furthermore, social media can facilitate cyberbullying (Kowalski et al., 2014) and create unrealistic expectations and comparisons (Chou & Edge, 2012). However, this argument may not fully account for the positive aspects of social media in fostering communication and connection.

Both arguments present valid points, but neither captures the full complexity of social media's impact on relationships. It is important to recognize that social media can have both positive and negative effects on relationships, depending on the specific context and usage patterns. A more nuanced analysis might consider the balance between these positive and negative aspects, as well as individual and situational factors that may influence the overall impact of social media on relationships. In conclusion, while both arguments have merits, a more comprehensive understanding of the issue requires considering the interplay between the beneficial and detrimental aspects of social media use.

## Thesis

The impact of social media on relationships is multifaceted, and while it offers opportunities for enhanced communication and connection, it also presents significant challenges that can potentially harm interpersonal relationships.
