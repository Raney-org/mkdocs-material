# This should be my rough draft for school

The pervasive use of social media in today's society has sparked a lively debate on its impact on relationships. As a powerful communication tool, social media has the potential to both enhance and undermine the connections we have with others. In this paper, we will delve into the complex relationship between social media and interpersonal relationships, providing a balanced analysis of the best arguments from both proponents and critics. Our investigation will encompass the positive aspects of social media, such as fostering communication and maintaining long-distance connections, as well as the negative aspects, including the potential for addiction, cyberbullying, and the erosion of genuine face-to-face interactions. Drawing on scholarly evidence, we will present our own argument for the overall effect of social media on relationships and address the strongest counterarguments. By thoroughly examining the diverse perspectives on this issue, our aim is to arrive at a well-reasoned conclusion that sheds light on the true impact of social media on our interpersonal connections.
