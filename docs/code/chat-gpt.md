## Chat About git and releases

I'm attempting to get autobrr to be able to `curl` a local address. I installed another container called 'redactedhook' from github (https://github.com/s0up4200/redactedhook/tree/develop) when the container for redactedhook is running, I can use a curl command and reach the address http://127.0.0.1:42135 and the container shows that a connection was made. however, autobrr cannot see the address nor can it curl it. autobrr DOES have curl available. do you know what redactedhook and autobrr do?
ChatGPT
Yes, I can provide some information about both autobrr and redactedhook and why autobrr might not be able to access the redactedhook container using the address http://127.0.0.1:42135.

autobrr (https://github.com/autobrr/autobrr) is an easy-to-use download automation tool for torrents and Usenet. It can watch for announcements from various sources, such as IRC channels or websites, and automatically add torrents or NZBs to your download client when a match is found based on your filters.

redactedhook (https://github.com/s0up4200/redactedhook/tree/develop) is a Python script that listens for incoming HTTP requests and sends announcements to IRC channels. It can be used to send announcements for torrents from REDacted (a private music torrent tracker) to IRC channels, making it easier for users to stay updated with new torrents.

The reason autobrr is unable to access the redactedhook container using the address http://127.0.0.1:42135 is that both containers are running in separate network namespaces, and 127.0.0.1 refers to the loopback address of the container itself, not the host or other containers.

To make autobrr able to access the redactedhook container, you have a few options:

Use Docker's built-in DNS service: Docker provides a built-in DNS server that allows containers to resolve other container names within the same network. Connect both containers to the same Docker network (it seems they are both already connected to the "saltbox" network) and use the container name (e.g., "redactedhook") as the hostname in the URL, like http://redactedhook:42135.

Use the host's IP address: If the containers are running on the same host, you can use the host's IP address instead of 127.0.0.1 in the URL, like http://<host-IP>:42135. Make sure that the redactedhook container's port is properly exposed or published.

Use the IP address of the redactedhook container: You can find the IP address of the redactedhook container by running docker inspect redactedhook and looking for the IPAddress field under the Networks section. Use this IP address in the URL, like http://<container-IP>:42135.

Remember to replace the placeholders with the appropriate values. The first option, using Docker's built-in DNS service, is the most recommended approach since it automatically handles IP address changes and is more flexible.

User
there are some caveats to that that I don't think you've taken into consideration due to how redactedhook was built. Here is the readme for redactedhook:
### RedactedHook

RedactedHook is a webhook companion service for [autobrr](https://github.com/autobrr/autobrr) designed to check name of uploaders and your ratio on Redacted. It provides a simple and efficient way to validate if an uploader is blacklisted or if you want to stop racing in case your ratio falls below a certain point.

#### Featuress

* Verify if an uploader's name is on a provided blacklist

* Check if a user's ratio meets a specified minimum value

* Easy to integrate with other applications via webhook

It was made with [autobrr](https://github.com/autobrr/autobrr) in mind.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run RedactedHook, you'll need:

1. Go 1.20 or later installed (only if building from source)
2. Access to Redacted

### Installation

#### Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/s0up4200/redactedhook:latest
```

**docker compose**

```docker
version: "3.7"
services:
  redactedhook:
    container_name: redactedhook
    image: ghcr.io/s0up4200/redactedhook:latest
    user: 1000:1000
    network_mode: host
```

#### Using precompiled binaries

Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the [releases](https://github.com/s0up4200/RedactedHook/releases/latest) page.

#### Building from source

1. Clone the repository:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/raneydazed/RedactedHook.git
      ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

      ```bash
      cd RedactedHook
      ```

3. Build the project:

      ```go
      go build
      ```

      or

      ```shell
      make build
      ```

4. Run the compiled binary:

```bash
./bin/RedactedHook
```

The RedactedHook server will now be running on `0.0.0.0:42135`, or `http://redactedhook:42135` if you are running saltbox and compose instead of the binary.

### Usage

To use RedactedHook, send POST requests to the following endpoints:

#### Check Ratio

* Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:42135/redacted/ratio`

* Method: POST

* Expected HTTP Status: 200

**JSON Payload:**

```json
{
  "user_id": USER_ID,
  "apikey": "API_KEY",
  "minratio": MINIMUM_RATIO
}
```

`user_id` is the number in the URL when you visit your profile.

`api_key` your Redacted API key. Needs user and torrents privileges.

#### Check Uploader

* Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:42135/redacted/uploader`

* Method: POST

* Expected HTTP Status: 200

**JSON Payload:**

```json

{
  "torrent_id": {{.TorrentID}},
  "apikey": "API_KEY",
  "uploaders": "BLACKLISTED_USER1,BLACKLISTED_USER2,BLACKLISTED_USER3"
}
```

`torrent_id` will automatically be filled when you use `{{.TorrentID}}` - a macro supported by autobrr.

`api_key` your Redacted API key. Needs user and torrents privileges.

#### curl commands for easy testing

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user_id": 3855, "apikey": "e1be0c8f.6a1d6f89de6e9f6a61e6edcbb6a3a32d", "minratio": 1.0}' http://0.0.0.0:42135/redacted/ratio
```

&

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"torrent_id": 3931392, "apikey": "e1be0c8f.6a1d6f89de6e9f6a61e6edcbb6a3a32d", "uploaders": "blacklisted_user1,blacklisted_user2,blacklisted_user3"}' http://127.0.0.1:42135/redacted/uploader
ChatGPT
Thank you for providing more information on redactedhook. Based on the information from the README, redactedhook is designed to work with autobrr by providing webhook services to check uploaders' names and user ratios on REDacted.

In the provided docker-compose.yml file, the redactedhook container is set up with network_mode: host, which means it shares the same network namespace as the host, and the container listens on the host's network interfaces. This also means that the container can be accessed using the host's IP address.

To make autobrr able to access the redactedhook container, you can use the host's IP address instead of 127.0.0.1 in the URL, like http://<host-IP>:42135. Make sure that the redactedhook container's port is properly exposed or published.

If both containers are running on the same host, you can use the host's IP address in the webhook URL. However, if they are running on different hosts, you'll need to make sure that the port 42135 is exposed on the host running the redactedhook container and use the appropriate IP address in the webhook URL.

If you prefer to use Docker's built-in DNS service, you'll need to remove the network_mode: host from the redactedhook's docker-compose.yml and make sure both containers are connected to the same Docker network. Then, you can use the container name (e.g., "redactedhook") as the hostname in the URL, like http://redactedhook:42135.

I don't think changing the network_mode will allow me to reach the container any easier. am I wrong?
ChatGPT
You're right that the main.go file sets the server to listen on 127.0.0.1:42135. This means it's binding to the loopback network interface, which is only accessible within the container itself.

To make the redactedhook container accessible from other containers or the host, you can update the main.go file and change the IP address to 0.0.0.0, like this:

go
Copy code
err := http.ListenAndServe("0.0.0.0:42135", nil)
By changing the IP address to 0.0.0.0, you're telling the server to listen on all network interfaces, making it accessible from other containers or the host.

After making this change, you will need to rebuild the redactedhook container.

If you don't want to modify the source code, you can remove the network_mode: host from the redactedhook's docker-compose.yml, and add a ports section to expose the 42135 port like this:

yaml
Copy code
version: "3.7"
services:
  redactedhook:
    container_name: redactedhook
    image: ghcr.io/s0up4200/redactedhook:latest
    user: 1000:1000
    ports:
      - "42135:42135"
However, this approach would still require the redactedhook to bind to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1. If you don't want to change the code or build a new container, you can try using the --net=host option with autobrr to run it in the host network namespace. This way, both containers will be running in the host's network namespace, and autobrr should be able to reach redactedhook at http://127.0.0.1:42135.

Keep in mind that running containers in the host network namespace may not be the best practice for security and network isolation. Modifying the redactedhook source code to bind to 0.0.0.0 and using a custom network is the recommended approach.

ChatGPT
The workflow file you provided should automatically create releases for you when you push tags that start with 'v'. However, there's one thing you should double-check to ensure that the releases are created successfully:

Make sure you have a GitHub secret named GORELEASER_TOKEN set up with a personal access token. This token is used to authenticate against the GitHub API and create the releases.
Here's how you can create a personal access token and add it to your repository secrets:

Go to your GitHub account settings.
In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings."
In the left sidebar, click on "Personal access tokens."
Click on the "Generate new token" button.
Give the token a descriptive name, e.g., "GoReleaser Token."
Under the "Select scopes" section, check the "repo" scope.
Click on the "Generate token" button at the bottom of the page.
Copy the generated token.
Now, add the token to your repository secrets:

Go to your forked redactedhook repository on GitHub.
Click on the "Settings" tab.
In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets."
Click on the "New repository secret" button.
Enter the secret name as GORELEASER_TOKEN and paste the token you copied earlier in the "Value" field.
Click on the "Add secret" button.
Now, your workflow should be able to create releases whenever you push a tag starting with 'v'.





User
do I not need to change any of the references to "github.repository_owner == 's0up4200"?
ChatGPT
Yes, you should change the references to 's0up4200' to match your own GitHub username, so the condition works correctly for your forked repository.

Replace 's0up4200' with your GitHub username in the following sections:

In the "docker" job, under "Build and publish Docker images":
yaml
Copy code
push: ${{ github.repository_owner == 'your_github_username' }}
In the same "docker" job, under "Extract metadata":
yaml
Copy code
images: ghcr.io/your_github_username/redactedhook
By making these changes, the workflow will correctly work with your forked repository and create releases and Docker images under your own GitHub account.





User
should I change anything in "dockerfile"? 
here is what is currently on the repo: 

# build app

EXPOSE 42135

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/redactedhook"]
#CMD ["--config", "/config"]
will it work set up like this?
ChatGPT
Yes, the Dockerfile seems to be correctly set up to build the redactedhook application using a multi-stage build. However, there's one reference to the original repository owner in the LABEL instruction that you might want to update to your GitHub username:

Dockerfile
Copy code
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source = "https://github.com/your_github_username/redactedhook"
This label specifies the source repository for the image, so it's a good idea to update it with your forked repository URL. Other than that, the Dockerfile looks fine and should work as expected.





User
should i then also change the ci.dockerfile as well? 
# build app

EXPOSE 7474

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/redactedhook"]
#CMD ["--config", "/config"]
ChatGPT
Yes, you should update the ci.Dockerfile as well to reference your forked repository. Change the LABEL instruction to use your GitHub username:

Dockerfile
Copy code
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source = "https://github.com/your_github_username/redactedhook"
This label specifies the source repository for the image, so it's a good idea to update it with your forked repository URL.

After updating this label, the ci.Dockerfile should work as expected when building the image in the GitHub Actions workflow.

The .goreleaser.yml file you provided looks good for your raneydazed/redactedhook repository. This configuration should properly build, archive, and release binaries for the specified platforms.

Make sure you have the correct repository information in the release section:

yaml
Copy code
release:
  prerelease: auto
  footer: |
    **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/raneydazed/redactedhook/compare/{{ .PreviousTag }}...{{ .Tag }}
    
    ## Docker images
    
    - `docker pull ghcr.io/raneydazed/redactedhook:{{ .Tag }}`
I've updated the footer with the correct repository URL (all lowercase). If you are satisfied with the platforms and architectures specified in the configuration file, you should be good to go.





User
would you suggest any changes to the docker-compose.yml after everything you've seen so far? 
version: "3.7"
services:
  redactedhook:
    container_name: redactedhook
    image: ghcr.io/raneydazed/redactedhook:latest
    user: 1000:1001
    network_mode: saltbox
ChatGPT
The docker-compose.yml file you provided looks good and should work with your raneydazed/redactedhook repository. However, you may want to consider adding a few additional settings to improve the usability and configuration of the container.

Add environment variables, if required by your application.
Add volume mounts to persist data or configuration files outside the container.
Expose the necessary ports to enable communication between the container and the host or other containers.
Here's an example docker-compose.yml file with these suggestions:

yaml
Copy code
version: "3.7"
services:
  redactedhook:
    container_name: redactedhook
    image: ghcr.io/raneydazed/redactedhook:latest
    user: 1000:1001
    network_mode: saltbox
    environment:
      - VARIABLE_NAME=variable_value
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./data:/data
    ports:
      - "42135:42135"
Replace VARIABLE_NAME and variable_value with any environment variables your application might require. Adjust the volume paths and port numbers to match your specific requirements.





User
have you seen anything that suggests there may be environment variables that I can use with this container?
ChatGPT
Based on the provided files, I don't see any explicit environment variables being used by the container. The application does use the following environment variables:

HOME
XDG_CONFIG_HOME
XDG_DATA_HOME
These are set in the Dockerfile:

makefile
Copy code
ENV HOME="/config" \
XDG_CONFIG_HOME="/config" \
XDG_DATA_HOME="/config"
It appears that the application's configuration and data storage is done within the /config directory. In this case, you could use a volume mount in your docker-compose.yml file to persist the configuration and data:

yaml
Copy code
version: "3.7"
services:
  redactedhook:
    container_name: redactedhook
    image: ghcr.io/raneydazed/redactedhook:latest
    user: 1000:1001
    network_mode: saltbox
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    ports:
      - "42135:42135"
This configuration will mount the ./config directory on the host to the /config directory within the container. If you need additional environment variables, you can add them to the environment section of the docker-compose.yml file. However, based on the information available, it doesn't seem like there are any other environment variables used by this container.





User
when i pushed changes to the main (develop) branch, it didnt create releases. is that because i didnt create a pr and just merged?
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. According to your /github/workflows/release.yml file, the release process is triggered when you push a new tag with a format like v*. Here's the relevant part of the file:

yaml
Copy code
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"
      - "develop"
    tags:
      - 'v*'
If you want to create a release, you should create a new tag with the desired version number and push it to the repository. For example:

bash
Copy code
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, and it will build and publish the release.

In the current configuration, the workflow will also run for pushes to the main and develop branches, but it won't create a release. The release creation is tied specifically to the presence of a tag.





User
how would i create the tag in vs code before creating the pull request
ChatGPT
To create a tag in Visual Studio Code before creating a pull request, follow these steps:

Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code by clicking Terminal in the menu bar and then clicking New Terminal. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + ~ (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + ~ (Mac).
Make sure you have committed all your changes.
In the terminal, check the current branch with the command git branch. Make sure you are on the branch you want to create the tag for.
Create the tag with the command git tag <tag_name>, where <tag_name> is the desired version number, such as v1.0.0. For example:
Copy code
git tag v1.0.0
Push the tag to the remote repository with the command git push origin <tag_name>, where <tag_name> is the same tag you created in step 4. For example:
perl
Copy code
git push origin v1.0.0
After pushing the tag, the GitHub Actions workflow should trigger and create the release as configured in your release.yml file.

Once the release is created, you can create a pull request as you normally would.

ChatGPT
The error is caused by the tag v0.1.6.1 not being a valid semantic version. Semantic versioning requires the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. In this case, there is an extra number in the tag.

To fix the issue, you should create a new tag with a valid semantic version format, such as v0.1.7. Follow these steps:

Delete the current invalid tag locally using the command git tag -d v0.1.6.1.
Delete the remote tag on GitHub using the command git push origin --delete v0.1.6.1.
Create a new valid tag by running git tag v0.1.7.
Push the new tag to the remote repository using the command git push origin v0.1.7.
After pushing the new tag, the GitHub Actions workflow should trigger again and proceed without the previous error.





User
that seems to have worked fine. but it says it skipped build/build go binaries. why would that be?
ChatGPT
It's likely that the "Build Go binaries" job was skipped because of the if condition specified in the workflow file. In the workflow file you provided earlier, there is a condition for the goreleaserbuild job:

yaml
Copy code
goreleaserbuild:
  name: Build Go binaries
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  ...
This condition states that the "Build Go binaries" job will only run if the GitHub event triggering the workflow is a pull request. Since you pushed a new tag, the event was not a pull request, and thus the "Build Go binaries" job was skipped.

If you want the "Build Go binaries" job to run for tag events as well, you can update the condition to include the tag events, like this:

csharp
Copy code
goreleaserbuild:
  name: Build Go binaries
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' || startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  ...
By adding startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/'), you are telling the workflow to run the "Build Go binaries" job when the event is a tag event as well.





User
after running the binary that the repo made, i got this output: 
2023-05-04 01:57:09 FTL Failed to start server error="listen tcp 0.0.0.0:42135: bind: address already in use"
ChatGPT
The error message "address already in use" indicates that another process is already using the port 42135 on your system. To resolve this issue, you have two options:

Find the process using the port and stop it:

a. On Linux/macOS, you can use the lsof command to find the process using the port:

css
Copy code
sudo lsof -i :42135
b. On Windows, you can use the netstat command to find the process using the port:

arduino
Copy code
netstat -aon | findstr "42135"
Once you've identified the process, you can stop it using the kill command on Linux/macOS or the Task Manager on Windows.

Change the port used by your application:

If you don't want to stop the process using the port or can't, you can update your application's configuration to use a different, unused port. You'll need to update both your application's configuration and any related files (e.g., Docker Compose files or service configuration files) to use the new port.

Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/raneydazed/redactedhook/manifests/latest": unauthorized
ChatGPT
The error message you received indicates an authentication issue when trying to pull the container image from the GitHub Container Registry. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

Ensure you have a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the read:packages scope. If you don't have one, create it by following the instructions in this GitHub guide.

Log in to the GitHub Container Registry using your PAT:

php
Copy code
docker login ghcr.io -u <your_github_username> -p <your_personal_access_token>
Replace <your_github_username> with your GitHub username and <your_personal_access_token> with the PAT you generated in step 1.

Once you're logged in, try running the docker-compose up -d command again. The pull should now work without the authentication error.

If you still face issues, double-check your PAT to ensure it has the correct permissions and make sure you're using the correct username and token when logging in.
