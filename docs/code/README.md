## Polyiso pieces cut list

- Two pieces that are 52.5 inches by 22 inches
- Two pieces that are 1.5 inches by 22 inches
- Two pieces that are 1.5 inches by 52.5 inches

To calculate the total number of pieces of polyiso foam you'll need, multiply the number of pieces needed for each panel by the total number of panels on both garage doors:

- Two pieces that are 52.5 inches by 22 inches per panel x 8 panels per door x 2 doors = 32 pieces
- Two pieces that are 1.5 inches by 22 inches per panel x 8 panels per door x 2 doors = 32 pieces
- Two pieces that are 1.5 inches by 52.5 inches per panel x 8 panels per door x 2 doors = 32 pieces

Therefore, you'll need a total of 96 pieces of polyiso foam for both garage doors.
