### Two different perspectives on whether social media is harmful to relationships

#### Perspective A

Social media is harmful to relationships because it can lead to feelings of jealousy, insecurity, and decreased intimacy. People may compare their relationships to the seemingly perfect ones they see online, causing dissatisfaction and unrealistic expectations.

#### Perspective B

Social media can actually strengthen relationships by providing a platform for communication, sharing experiences, and staying connected with loved ones who live far away. It can also help people find support and advice from others in similar situations.

### Evaluating the reasoning surrounding this topic

1. Competing positions: The two positions are clear, with one arguing that social media is harmful to relationships and the other arguing that it can be beneficial.
2. Contradiction: The two perspectives do contradict each other, as they present opposing views on the impact of social media on relationships.
3. Evidence: The strength of evidence supporting the premises of each argument depends on the specific studies, data, and expert opinions cited by each side. A thorough analysis would require examining the quality and relevance of the evidence provided.
4. Good reasoning: Both arguments can use good reasoning if they present logical connections between their premises and conclusions, and if they avoid fallacies or biases.
5. Fallacies or biases: It is essential to examine each side's arguments for potential fallacies or biases, such as hasty generalizations, anecdotal evidence, or confirmation bias.
6. Reasons for different perspectives: People may hold different positions based on their personal experiences, values, or the specific evidence they have encountered. Additionally, social media's impact on relationships can vary depending on individual circumstances and usage patterns.
7. Expression of perspectives: Both sides could express their perspectives more effectively by providing clear, well-structured arguments, citing relevant and reliable evidence, and addressing potential counterarguments or limitations of their positions.

### Evaluating the rhetoric surrounding this topic

1. Civility and fairness: It is important for people discussing this issue to be civil and fair-minded, engaging in respectful dialogue and considering opposing viewpoints without resorting to personal attacks or straw man arguments.
2. Striving for fairness, objectivity, and civility: By focusing on evidence-based reasoning, acknowledging potential biases, and treating others with respect, individuals can contribute to a more productive conversation around this topic.
3. Progress on the issue: If society were to approach this issue with greater fairness, objectivity, and civility, it would be more likely to make progress in understanding the complex relationship between social media and interpersonal relationships, and potentially develop strategies to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of social media use.

## Proposed Answer, Option 2

Topic: Is social media harmful to relationships?

Two different perspectives:

Perspective A: Social media can negatively impact relationships by causing decreased time with a partner, missed connections, jealousy, conflict, negative comparisons, and hurt feelings (Patterson, 2020).

Perspective B: Social media can positively impact relationships by allowing people to be more aware and engaged in the lives of their partners, facilitating communication, providing a platform to share their relationship with the world, connecting long-distance couples, and helping single people meet (Patterson, 2020).

Evaluate the reasoning surrounding this topic:

- Competing positions

The competing positions are clear, with one side arguing that social media can have negative effects on relationships and the other arguing that it can have positive effects.

- Contradiction

The two perspectives do not necessarily contradict each other, as they present different aspects of the impact of social media on relationships. It is possible for social media to have both positive and negative effects, depending on individual circumstances and usage patterns.

- Evidence

The provided excerpts cite specific studies and data to support the arguments, which strengthens the reasoning behind both the negative and positive effects of social media on relationships (Patterson, 2020).

- Good reasoning

Both arguments use good reasoning by presenting logical connections between their premises and conclusions and avoiding fallacies or biases.

- Fallacies or biases

It is essential to examine each side's arguments for potential fallacies or biases, such as hasty generalizations, anecdotal evidence, or confirmation bias.

- Reasons for different perspectives

People may hold different positions based on their personal experiences, values, or the specific evidence they have encountered.

- Expression of perspectives

Both sides could express their perspectives more effectively by providing clear, well-structured arguments, citing relevant and reliable evidence, and addressing potential counterarguments or limitations of their positions.

### Evaluate the rhetoric that surrounds this topic

- Civility and fairness

The provided excerpts seem to approach the issue with civility and fairness, acknowledging both positive and negative aspects of social media's impact on relationships (Patterson, 2020).

- Striving for fairness, objectivity, and civility

By focusing on evidence-based reasoning and considering different aspects of the issue, the excerpts contribute to a more productive conversation around this topic.

- Progress on the issue

If society were to approach this issue with greater fairness, objectivity, and civility, it would be more likely to make progress in understanding the complex relationship between social media and interpersonal relationships. By doing so, we could potentially develop strategies to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of social media use in the context of romantic relationships.

---

Both sides of the argument can potentially commit fallacies or biases. Here are examples of how each side might use at least one fallacy:

Perspective A (Social media is harmful to relationships):

Fallacy: Hasty generalization

Someone arguing that social media is harmful to relationships might rely on a few personal anecdotes or isolated incidents where social media use led to relationship problems, without considering the broader context or more comprehensive data.

To avoid this fallacy, proponents of Perspective A should consider a broader range of evidence, including scientific studies and expert opinions.

Perspective B (Social media is beneficial to relationships):

Fallacy: Anecdotal evidence

Someone arguing that social media is beneficial to relationships might base their argument primarily on personal stories or individual experiences of how social media helped them or others stay connected with their partners, without considering scientific studies, statistical data, or expert opinions.

To avoid this fallacy, proponents of Perspective B should also consider a wider range of evidence, including scientific studies and expert opinions.

By recognizing and addressing these potential fallacies, both sides can engage in a more balanced, objective, and evidence-based discussion about the impact of social media on relationships.
