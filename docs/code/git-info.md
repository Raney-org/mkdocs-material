# Git Info

## Where to Start

So I've been bothering old Chat-GPT with millions of questions lately. Its pretty great. I'll try to keep this legible, but no guarantees. I was all over the place with my questions. I'll probably refactor this a hundred times before I'm satisfied with it, but here we go!

## Some Questions for You Mr. GPT

### How do I set up vs code to commmit everything as a bot? and if I wanted to commit it as a bot with a gpg key, how would I do that?

To commit changes in VS Code as a bot, you need to configure Git with the bot's name and email address. Additionally, if you want to sign commits with a GPG key, you need to set up GPG for the bot and configure Git to use it.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Configure Git with the bot's name and email address:[^1]

[^1]: Note: this requires you to have `git` installed on your device.

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code and run the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Bot Name"
git config --global user.email "your-bot-email@example.com"
```

Replace "Your Bot Name" and "your-bot-email@example.com" with the actual bot name and email address.

1. Set up GPG for the bot:

First, make sure you have GPG installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [GnuPG's official website](https://discord.com/channels/636941159704559617/636967268579803156/1099805846768193536).

Next, open the integrated terminal in VS Code and generate a new GPG key for the bot:

```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

Follow the prompts to create a new key. Make sure to use the bot's email address when asked for the user ID.

1. Configure Git to use the GPG key:

After generating the GPG key, list your GPG keys to get the key ID:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

Look for the line starting with `sec` and copy the key ID (the part after the `/` and before the date).

Now, configure Git to use this GPG key:

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
```

Replace `YOUR_KEY_ID` with the actual key ID you just copied.

1. Configure Git to sign all commits automatically:

To sign all commits automatically, run the following command:[^2]

[^2]: Keep in mind, this will make every commit to every repo you commit to use this.

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Now, when you commit changes in VS Code, they will be committed as the configured bot and signed with the GPG key.

1. Add the GPG public key to your GitHub account:

To show the "Verified" badge on your commits on GitHub, you need to add the GPG public key to your GitHub account.

First, export the public key:

```bash
gpg --armor --export your-bot-email@example.com
```

Replace `your-bot-email@example.com` with the bot's email address. This command will output the public key in the terminal.

Copy the public key, including the lines `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----` and `-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`.

Then, go to your GitHub account settings, navigate to the "SSH and GPG keys" section, click on "New GPG key," and paste the public key. Click "Add GPG Key"

???+ note
    I went and stopped the illustrious chat bot right there. I'd had enough. You see, I only wanted this to work on/in one single github repo, not across any others that I contribute to, as I help with docs in another org that isn't associated with me and of which I am not a member. Because they are mean. But, I digress.

### I don't want to do this globally, just for my "raney-org/mkdocs-materials" github repo. I want to use my normal username and email for other repos

In that case, you can set the Git configuration and GPG signing on a per-repository basis. Here's how to do that for your specific repository:

1. Open the "raney-org/mkdocs-materials" repository in VS Code.

2. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.

3. Configure Git with the bot's name and email address for this specific repository:[^3]

[^3]: Replace `"Your Bot Name"` and `"your-bot-email@example.com"` with the actual bot name and email address.

> ```bash
> git config user.name "Your Bot Name"
> git config user.email "your-bot-email@example.com"
> ```

4. Configure Git to use the GPG key for this specific repository:

```bash
git config user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
```

Replace `YOUR_KEY_ID` with the actual key ID of the GPG key you want to use for this repository.

5. Configure Git to sign all commits automatically for this specific repository:

```bash
git config commit.gpgsign true
```

Now, when you commit changes in the `raney-org/mkdocs-materials` repository in VS Code, they will be committed as the configured bot and signed with the `GPG key`. This configuration will not affect other repositories on your system.

### How do you configure vs code to auto commit and push to a github remote?

Visual Studio Code does not have a built-in feature to auto-commit and push changes to a GitHub remote. However, you can create a simple script to automate the process and use the integrated terminal in VS Code to run the script whenever you want to commit and push your changes.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a new file called `commit-and-push.sh` in the root of your repository.

2. Add the following content to the `commit-and-push.sh` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Change the commit message to your desired message
commit_message="Auto-commit: Update files"

# Add all changes to staging
git add .

# Commit the changes with the specified commit message
git commit -m "$commit_message"

# Push the changes to the remote repository
git push
```

3. Save the file and close it.

4. Make the script executable by running the following command in the integrated terminal in VS Code:

```bash
chmod +x commit-and-push.sh
```

5. Now, whenever you want to auto-commit and push your changes to the GitHub remote, simply run the script in the integrated terminal:

```bash
./commit-and-push.sh
```

This script will stage all changes, commit them with the specified commit message, and push the changes to the remote repository.

Please note that this method is manual and requires you to run the script each time you want to commit and push changes. There is no built-in feature in VS Code to automatically commit and push changes on a predefined schedule or event.

### What is a git sub module and what is a git tracking branch

A Git submodule and a Git tracking branch are two different concepts in Git. Let me explain each one:

1. Git Submodule:

A Git submodule is a mechanism for including an external Git repository within another Git repository. It allows you to keep another repository as a subdirectory within your main repository while maintaining its history. This is particularly useful when you want to include a library or a shared component in your project that is developed and maintained in a separate repository.

When you add a submodule to your repository, Git stores a reference to the submodule's commit, rather than storing the entire submodule's code. This keeps the main repository lightweight and allows you to update the submodule independently.

To add a submodule to your repository, use the following command:[^4]

[^4]:
    Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the external repository you want to include, and `<path_to_submodule>` with the desired path for the submodule within your main repository.

```bash
git submodule add <repository_url> <path_to_submodule>
```

2. Git Tracking Branch:

A Git tracking branch is a local branch that is connected to a remote branch. When you push or pull changes, the tracking branch automatically knows which remote branch to interact with. This makes it easier to stay in sync with the remote repository, as you don't have to specify the remote branch each time you push or pull changes.

By default, when you clone a remote repository or create a new branch from a remote branch, Git sets up a tracking relationship between the local and remote branches. You can also set up a tracking branch manually by using the following command:

```bash
git branch --track <local_branch> <remote_branch>
```

Replace `<local_branch>` with the name of the local branch you want to create, and `<remote_branch>` with the name of the remote branch you want to track (in the format `origin/branch_name`).

In summary, a Git submodule is a way to include an external repository within your main repository, while a Git tracking branch is a local branch that is connected to a remote branch for easier synchronization.

### can you give me an example of the file structure for using sub modules? say I have my main git repo at /home/raneydazed/pr/ and I have the sub module at /home/raneydazed/pr/sub-mod/. how would I refer to the sub module in the git submodule add command

In your example, if you have your main Git repository at `/home/raneydazed/pr/` and you want to add a submodule at `/home/raneydazed/pr/sub-mod/`, you should use a relative path for the submodule when running the `git submodule add command`.

First, navigate to your main repository:

```shell
cd /home/raneydazed/pr/
```

Now, assuming the submodule's remote repository URL is `https://github.com/user/submodule-repo.git`, you can add the submodule using the following command:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/user/submodule-repo.git sub-mod
```

This command will create a new directory called `sub-mod` within your main repository at `/home/raneydazed/pr/sub-mod/` and clone the submodule repository into it. The submodule's commit reference will be stored in the `.gitmodules` file in the root of your main repository.

The resulting file structure will look like this:[^5]

[^5]:
    Remember to replace `https://github.com/user/submodule-repo.git` with the actual remote repository URL of the submodule you want to add.

```bash
/home/raneydazed/pr/
│   .git/
│   .gitmodules
│   ...
└───sub-mod/
    │   .git/
    │   ...
```
