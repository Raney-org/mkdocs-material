# Radarr

So I migrated from sqlite to postgresql today on my radarr4k container. It seemed to go pretty well! I'll just monitor it for a while I suppose. 

[Here](https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr/postgres-setup) is the link to the setup/tutorial, I'll probably make my own as that assumes that you know more than you do IMO. I fiddle fucked with it for forever until I got it to work.
