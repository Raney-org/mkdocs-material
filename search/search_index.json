If you are familiar with the criminal justice system or television crime dramas, you may know that a warrant is an authoritative document that permits the search and seizure of potential evidence or the arrest of a person believed to have committed a crime. Without a warrant, such search and seizure, as well as coercing an individual to submit to interrogation or imprisonment, is a violation of the protections and rights that individuals in free societies enjoy. The warrant certifies that the search or arrest of a person is justified\u2014that there is sufficient reason or evidence to show that the search or arrest does not unduly violate the person\u2019s rights.

As such, they must be the kind of thing that is either true or false.  Note claims aren't necessarily true but are presented as true. If a sentence cannot be regarded as true or false, such as a question, an exclamation, or a command, it does not make a claim. Arguments use claims as premises and conclusions. Each premise and conclusion should contain one and only one claim.</p> <p>A fact is a thing that is known or proved to be true, for example, a piece of information used as evidence.</p> <p>For a more in-depth discussion of this topic see section 2.1.</p> <p>another one:</p> <p>An argument attempts to show that a conclusion is true; an explanation attempts to show why it is true.</p> <p>To determine whether a passage is an argument or an explanation, look at the central claim. Is it the author's intent to convince you that the claim is true or to tell you why it is true? The former is indicative of an argument, the latter of an explanation. The conclusion of an explanation is therefore already an accepted truth and is therefore likely to be less controversial than the premises.</p> <p>For a more in-depth discussion of this topic see section 2.4.</p> <p>Hopefully, the last one:</p> <p>Logic deals in inference, or the process of arriving at the conclusion that would follow from the reasons offered in the premises. The broadest distinction in arguments is a distinction in inferences, that is, the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. The distinction between deductive and inductive arguments is ultimately a distinction in the strength of the connection between the premises and the conclusion.</p> <p>In deductive arguments, the intent is for the conclusion to follow from the premises by necessity. That is, if we accept all of the premises, we must accept the conclusion as well.</p> <p>By contrast, in an inductive argument, the intent is for the conclusion to be made more likely by the premises. If we accept that the premises are true, this gives us very good reason to accept the conclusion.
